# About Project
It is a Blazor project I used advanced SASS in it. It's a reminder for me, nothing else :)

# Story
I was the sole developer in the early stages of (awesome) Bit foundation website and I asked to do the best as usual by the Bit team head, Yaser Moradi (@ysmoradi), bring designs into 
screen with less possible amount of codes and most possible amount of quality, so I tried to do that and used all the great feature of SASS like Variables, Partials, Mixins 
and Includes, Functions, Nesting and with using of new modern rem, em units based their right place to use and apply Responsive Web Desing too (I did that Desktop first, as I'm easier 
with that)

# Update
